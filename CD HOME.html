	<p>CoderDojo is a movement orientated around running free not-for-profit coding clubs and regular sessions for young people. Founded By James Whelton and Bill Lao in Cork, Ireland in 2013. James and Bill were self taught programmers and wanted to create a space where young people could learn code in a social environment. Within one year, CoderDojo has spread across Ireland and other cities like London in England and San Francisco in The United States and various other parts of the world</p>

   <p class="clear"> We aim to teach the next generation the art of coding. Coderdojo welcomes all children who take interest in coding ages 7 to 16.  Children under the age of 10 may have a parent with them to help them or comfort them throughout the session.</p>
